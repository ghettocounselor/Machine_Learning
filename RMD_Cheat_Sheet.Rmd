## R Markdown cheat sheet

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Summarize data

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

If you don't want to see warnings 'message=FALSE' 

## Include an image

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/markloessi/Machine_Learning/Confusion_Matrix_Explained.png")
```

Compute accuracy from a confusion matrix. In this example it's a three column CM
See Lecture 282 https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/lecture/6453704 @1502 time
```{r , include=TRUE}
cm = table(test_set[, 3], y_pred)
cm
accuracy = (cm[1,1] + cm[2,2]) / (cm[1,1] + cm[2,2] + cm[1,2] + cm[2,1])
return(accuracy)
```
