# Importing the dataset

dataset = read.csv('Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv')
```

What's this about
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Pic from Python but same idea", out.width = '100%'}

```

# Implementing RANDOM Selection - literally random for comparison
```{r , include=TRUE}
N = 10000
d = 10
ads_selected = integer(0)
total_reward = 0
for (n in 1:N) {
  ad = sample(1:10, 1)
  ads_selected = append(ads_selected, ad)
  reward = dataset[n, ad]
  total_reward = total_reward + reward
}
```
Let's have a look at the total rewards calculated at random. 
```{r , include=TRUE}
total_reward
```
# Visualising the results - RANDOM
```{r , include=TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
hist(ads_selected,
     col = 'blue',
     main = 'Histogram of ads selections - RANDOM',
     xlab = 'Ads',
     ylab = 'Number of times each ad was selected')
```
